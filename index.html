            Playing PC games like Call of Duty Warzone with my fiance and
            friends is always a good time.

          <p>
            Programming can keep you at your desk for hours on end so I like to
            sign up for races to motivate me to workout daily and stay in good
            health.

            There is nothing better than staying up around a campfire with
            friends and family while eating smores.
